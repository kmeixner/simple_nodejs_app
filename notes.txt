Notes: This will generate package.js and package-lock.js which should be
committed to your Git archive.

You should commit both package.json and package-lock.json to your Git repository. The package.json file contains metadata about your project and its dependencies, while the package-lock.json file ensures that the exact versions of all dependencies are installed, leading to reproducible builds.

The package-lock.json file is particularly important for maintaining consistency across different environments and ensuring that everyone working on the project has the same dependency tree.

When you commit package-lock.json, it helps prevent issues caused by different versions of dependencies being installed on different machines, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

In summary, committing both package.json and package-lock.json to your Git repository is recommended to ensure consistency and reproducibility in your project's dependency management.
